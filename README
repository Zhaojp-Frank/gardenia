The code infrastructure is ported from Lonstargpu by the ISS group at the University of Texas.
To run the benchmarks on a simulator, please find the revised GPGPU-Sim version here:
https://github.com/chenxuhao/gpgpu-sim-ndp
and we highly recommend you to use CUDA-5.5 for the compatibility issue.

DESCRIPTION
bc: betweenness centrality
bfs: breadth first search
color: graph coloring
mst: minimum spanning tree (TODO: simulation does not terminate)
pr: page rank
sssp: single source shortest path

INSTALLATION
You will need to download and install CUB from here:
http://nvlabs.github.io/cub/
Place a symlink to the top-level CUB directory in $HOME. 
Assuming the top-level CUB directory is $CUBDIR:
$ cd $HOME
$ ln -s $CUBDIR
Go to each sub-directory, e.g. bfs, and then
$ make
